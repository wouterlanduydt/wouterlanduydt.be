<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Brief</span><br/>
Create an attractive promosite for possible sponosors. After seing this site they need to be informed and convinced to sponsor the festival.

<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Concept</span><br/>
I got some pictures and the logo. Offcourse everything needed to be Unifac-themed, so I used their blue and a lot of whitespace.

I designed the website in Sketch and we colaborated using Marvel. They commented on my designs and I uploaded a new version. Collaboration was quick and easy!

To create the interactive parts in the website (like the image silder and contact panes) I used React.
