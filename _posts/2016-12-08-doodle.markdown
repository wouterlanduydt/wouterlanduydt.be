<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Brief</span><br/>
As a member of the Google motion design team, you get besides a big salary and free Kopi Luwak double espresso shots (what a bummer I don't drink coffee) the chance to *design a new Google Doodle*! You pick an event or day in the future that has some meaning to you.

<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Concept</span><br/>
I choose the *day of the firefighter*. Mainly because I had a clear vision of what I wanted to animate and because it was just a few days after the deadline.

Before I started this project I had little to no experience in 2D animation. I *learned a lot* of the basics and was pretty happy with the result.
