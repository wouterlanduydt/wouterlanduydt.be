As a member of the Google motion design team, you get besides a big salary and free Kopi Luwak double espresso shots (what a bummer I don't drink coffee ðŸ˜¢) the chance to design a new Google Doodle! You pick an event or day in the future that has some meaning to you.

I choose the day of the firefighter. Mainly because I had a clear vision of what I wanted to animate and because it was just a few days after the deadline.
