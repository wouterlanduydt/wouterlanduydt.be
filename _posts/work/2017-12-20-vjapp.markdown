<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Brief</span><br/>
Create a web application using *one technology seen in class* and one *new technology*. Because this is an experiment, there are no browser requirements.

<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Concept</span><br/>
I've always been a big fan of MIDI-devices, mainly because I played around with them while I was still busy with DJ'ing. So we were pretty sure we wanted to do something with *Web Midi*.

We had been playing around with a *Traktor Kontrol F1*'s MIDI controls and changing the width and height of a *three.js* plane we made in class, but wanted to go further.

As a final concept we came up with a VJ application, *using the MIDI output to manipulate WebGL objects*. There are three scenes you can switch through and manipulate the speed, size, beat sensitivity, colors, materials,... of the objects. We also created some "one-shot" effects like a strobe, fade out and a disco effect. As a bonus we implemented *Web Audio* to detect the frequencies of the music and use it to manipulate the visuals even further.

We learned a lot with this project. It was hard figuring out all the different technologies, but we're very happy with the final result.
