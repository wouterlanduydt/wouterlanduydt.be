<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Brief</span><br/>
A creative idea, the incredible investment idea, in short, -insert name here- is ready to launch the most succesful campaign ever. They count on your help to communicate their message to their 1000's of backers on *Kickstarter*.

Create an *explainer video* that visualises their concept, filosofy and message. You choose an existing concept on Kickstarter that can use your help and bring your 2D version of their story.

<span class="post-content-text-subtitle" >Concept</span><br/>
This was my first real 2D animation project. I choose *<a href="http://www.offassignment.com/" target="_blank">Off Assignment's</a>* Kickstarter campaign, mainly because of their strong ambition. They want to bring real stories to the people instead of weak fake stories you read on the internet these days.

I went with this *monochrome style* because their message is to te point. Real stories. No nonsense and therefor a clean color pallette.

With this project I learned a lot about how to keep my After Effects projects *organised*. It was also interesting to work on a project *from a-z*, from creating a script and storyboard until mixing audio from the voice actor and animating the frames.
